# Pipelined_Multipication_Module
An attempt of creating faster multiplication circuit with HDL VHDL


This project is based upon the tasks which were given in my second week of FPGA implementation internship at university lab.
Initially the instructor described the submodules of a simple generic multipication module and expected us to build the code also test the results.

In first glanse  most of the submodules seems unneccesery
